The user will use this command to run the program:
 java topsecret

When the user does not specify any command-line arguments, it should list the numbered files available to display. E.g.:

01 filea.txt
02 fileb.txt
03 filec.txt

When the program runs with a number as an argument (e,g. the user types the following command to list the content of file 01):
 java topsecret 01
the contents of the corresponding file are printed to the terminal.

If the user enters a non-number argument or a number that is not in the list of numbered files available, it will show an error message:
"You did not enter a valid file number. Please run the program without arguments to see a list of available files and their numbers."

The program exits after showing the file list, the contents of an indicated file, or after displaying an error message.
